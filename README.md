# Credit-Calculator
Calculator written in Python that can determine annuity monthly payments, credit principal, differentiated monthly payments, and how long it will take to pay back a loan. Alongside this, the credit calculator will also find over-payments and has two modes, command line (where you input data via a command line) and regular (where you run the python file, prompting the program to ask you to input the information).
